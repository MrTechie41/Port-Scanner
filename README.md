# Port-Scanner
This Port Scanner is coded in python to test my knowledge in python programming.
The python libraries used in this project are sys, socket, datetime and time. 
This is a CLI based tool which directy takes the IP address and the ports as input and scans those ports. 
It returns the open ports as output. It also returns the time taken by the program to scan the mentioned ports.
